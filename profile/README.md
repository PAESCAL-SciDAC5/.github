# Welcome to PAESCAL's GitHub organization

PAESCAL, or _Physical, Accurate, and Efficient atmosphere and surface coupling across SCALes_, is a collaboration among Earth system modelers, applied mathematicians, computational scientists, and computer scientists supported by the US DOE through the 5th instantiation of the SciDAC (Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing) program.

We are using a combination of GitHub, Google Drive, Slack, Overleaf to organize our communications and work. See more details below. 

## Google Drive ([root directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g4sARFUXLBBKqlsvTg8_gFkA_oyavHUc?usp=sharing))

For access, please post the email address associated with your Google account to the `general` channel on Slack.

<!---

Types of repos in this organization:

- Atmospheric model and parameterization codes, including PAESCAL-owned codes as well as forks and mirrors of other's repos (e.g., E3SM, CLUBB).
- Task team's collaboration spaces for keeping meeting notes and sharing scripts, how-to documents, etc. These repos' names start with "task-notes-".
- Project management and outreach-related repos. E.g., [project-notes](https://github.com/PAESCAL-SciDAC5/project-notes) which keeps notes for the all-hands meetings; [public-website-dev](https://github.com/PAESCAL-SciDAC5/public-website-dev) and [PAESCAL-SciDAC5.github.io](https://github.com/PAESCAL-SciDAC5/PAESCAL-SciDAC5.github.io) which are used for developing and deploying the project's public website.

Large binary files (e.g., presentation PPT files and data files) should be stored somewhere else (further info to be included).

Manuscripts and documents that our team members are collectively editing are more likely stored on Overleaf or Google Doc.
