# Welcome to PAESCAL's GitHub organization

PAESCAL, or _Physical, Accurate, and Efficient atmosphere and surface coupling across SCALs_, is a collaboration among Earth system modelers, applied mathematicians, computational scientists, and computer scientists supported by the US DOE through the 5th instantiation of the SciDAC (Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing) program.

Types of repos in this organization:

- Atmospheric model and parameterization codes, including PAESCAL-owned codes as well as forks and mirrors of other's repos (e.g., E3SM, CLUBB).
- Task team's collaboration spaces for keeping meeting notes and sharing scripts, how-to documents, etc. These repos' names start with "task-notes-".
- Project management and outreach related repos.

Large binary files (e.g., presentation PPT files and data files) should be stored somewhere else (further info to be included).

Manuscripts and documents being collectively worked upon can be stored on Overleaf.
